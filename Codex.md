# Codex Vitae

## Instructions

**If you are Anthony:**

1. As often as you can: re-read your [Type 3 beliefs](#type-3-opinions) (opinions).
2. At the beginning of every year archive the document.
3. Around your birthday every year, write a new yearly report.

**If you aren't Anthony:**

1. Read this with the understanding that you are different than me — the way I live my life is not the way you should live yours.
2. Read the [What is this?](#what-is-this) to figure out what is going on here, then come back and read through the [Beliefs](#beliefs) that seem interesting to you.
3. Check the [Changelog](#yearly-reports) for updates since you last visited.
4. Consider creating your own Codex ( [here's the template I based mine off of](https://www.penflip.com/terrie/codex-vitae-template) )

## What Is This?

### Codex vitae
This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is to write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything I have learned in my life. If I lost all of my memories somehow, this could be something that helped me remember who I am.

### Why?
This document's first form was officially put online in late 2016, after my wife linked me to [another Codex online](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md). Maintaining this document is a new experiment in self-documenting my life, with the hope of improving and adding clarity to my thoughts and beliefs.

Posts about this topic: [Codex Vitae](http://wayoftheduck.com/codex-vitae).

## Beliefs

### Type 1: Metabeliefs
Beliefs about beliefs.

- This section's purpose is to capture my beliefs about the universe.
- This document is always incomplete, imperfect, and out of date.
- Some of these beliefs will be proven wrong. Some won't be proven wrong but will be wrong anyway.
- I’m open to changing my mind at any time about any belief by evidence, persuasion, whimsy, or chance.
- Beliefs should [pay rent](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/) in anticipated experiences.

### Type 2: Perceptions
How reality seems to be. 2A is about how my mind and senses seem to work, 2B is about my take on spirituality, and 2C is about how I think the external world can be best explained based on the information I have.

#### 2A Perceptions: Senses
Personal mental and physical abilities, constraints, and biases.

- Free will is mostly an illusion, but a nice one to keep because it is highly practical.
- We are all building an incomplete model of the universe in our heads and usually operate under the assumption that this model is the real universe (again, it's practical).
- Our mental model of the universe evolved so we could better predict and act on long-term threats and opportunities.
- Consciousness is the sensation of our mental model of the universe constantly changing itself to integrate new information.
- Consciousness evolved to allow our mental model of the universe to examine, repair, and improve itself.
- Playing lots of games (of any kind: video, board, card, other) helps us build more accurate models of the universe than people who don’t.
- We can change our behavior and habits but it requires a ridiculous amount of energy.
- Most of the time (if not all of the time) we don’t change ourselves, but are rather changed by other things. That doesn’t mean we can’t tell a story about how we changed ourselves, and believe it.
- We create mental heuristics to reduce the amount of energy to retrieve, sort, and select from lists of likely possibilities.
- The byproduct of mental heuristics is that we are biased at all times in proportion to the number of heuristics we use.
- We are more affected by our biases than anyone wants to admit.
- To name a few: We tend to favor the beautiful, the reaffirming, and the expected. We tend to attribute too much credit to success (and under-credit luck).

#### 2B Perceptions: Supersenses
My take on the spiritual and supernatural.

- We don't have a "purpose" given to us, and that is a [good thing](https://youtu.be/3ht-ZyJOV2k).
- Souls don't exist as separate from the physical body.
- The gods of humanity's numerous religions do not exist.
- Intention can't create reality (it just primes our perception of it, and makes us more likely to notice opportunities).
- Astrology is entertainment, like the Myers Briggs test.
- Science can't explain everything, but it *is* the current best way to try and start.
- There is no heaven, hell, or any afterlife of any kind.
- We have no cosmic significance. Other than that the cosmos is significant and we are part of it.
- Magic does not exist. If it did, science could study it.

#### 2C Perceptions: Explanatory
Science, politics, and the universe.

- Micro and macro evolution happens.
- Something like the Big Bang happened.
- Nothing in our universe can travel faster than light.
- Non-carbon-based life forms are likely to exist.
- Aliens are likely to exist, but we will most likely discover their creations (ie. robots they made) before we discover them.
- Aliens will probably discover our own robots before they discover us.
- The vast majority of intelligent beings throughout the universe are probably more similar to robots and cyborgs than organically evolved life.
- Time travel is not possible.
- Technology will eventually disrupt all other human-created institutions (politics, religion, identity, economics, energy).
- Vaccinations are good for babies and society.

### Type 3: Opinions
Beliefs about society and how it should be structured.

- Gay marriage should be legal everywhere.
- Abortion should be legal everywhere.
- Assisted suicide should be legal everywhere.
- Health care should be available and affordable to everyone who needs it.
- The death penalty can be used in extreme and certain cases to protect the public, but only as a last resort.
- Prisons should be about protecting the public, not about punishment.
- Marijuana should be legal to grow, sell, buy, and carry.
- It should be easier and more expedient to put neglectful and irresponsible public servants in prison than the average citizen, not slower and more difficult.
- Guaranteed basic income should be a thing available to everyone.
- Free college education should be available to everyone who wants it.
- The Fourth Amendment should not be so ignored in America.
- The Second Amendment should be respected, as we cannot pick and choose what aspects of the Bill of Rights to care about. It is all or nothing.
- Generally there is too much harmful regulation in America (but also room for more positive regulation).
- People are overly authoritarian as a rule.
- Democracy is terribly flawed.

### Type 4: Predictions
How I think things will be in the future. (contains degree of confidence)

- Most (>50%) of the jobs currently lost will not ever be coming back to the US (95%).
- Automation poses a much greater risk to employment numbers than immigration. Automation will increasingly become a [greater problem](https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU) until addressed. (90%+)
- By 2050, human level general AI will be developed. (80%)
- Trump will not win re-election. (55%)
