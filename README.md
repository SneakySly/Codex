## What Is This?

### Codex vitae
This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is to write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything I have learned in my life. If I lost all of my memories somehow, this could be something that helped me remember who I am.

### Why?
This document's first form was officially put online in late 2016, after my wife linked me to [another Codex online](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md). Maintaining this document is a new experiment in self-documenting my life, with the hope of improving and adding clarity to my thoughts and beliefs.
